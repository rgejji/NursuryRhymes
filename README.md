# NursuryRhymes
A Nursery Rhyme Reader For Alexa

This code was made as a fun little project for me and my family that I thought to share, as is, to others.

Inside, you will find the files used to manage the lambda function responsible for the Nursery Rhymes alexa skill. The nursery rhymes used in the skill are primarily copied from wikipedia and other open source resources. 

If you have any questions or concerns about the code or content, feel free to contact me.
